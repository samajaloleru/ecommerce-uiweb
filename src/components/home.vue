					<p> Debt is rough on anyone — especially when it encroaches on your marriage, partnership, or family. 
						A spouse or partner may resent the other as a way of coping with debt. It is absolutely one of the leading predictors of divorce in recent times. 
						Large amounts of debt have severe effects on a household’s psychological well-being and it isn’t uncommon to look back with regret. 
						<br/>Having substantial debt can also increase your stress level at work, many become unproductive at their jobs and 
						that can even complicate the problems when they lose their jobs due to constant worry and lack of focus.
					</p>
					<p> The average person has $16,000 in debt. Meanwhile, the average college student will graduate with a whopping $40,000 in student loans — 
						and those who pursued graduate or higher degrees, switched majors, or went back to school may owe significantly more. 
						In fact, about one in five borrowers owes $50,000 or more in student loans (and 5.6% owe more than $100,000), according to a survey. 
						This is the same in different parts of the globe.
						<br/>Round it out with car loans, personal loans, medical debt, mortgages and other obligations; It’s safe to assume that a large number of people carry some kind of debt. 
					</p>
					<p> A whopping 64% of graduate students said their constant concern over debt interferes with their optimal functioning,
						<br/>Stress caused by debt doesn’t just affect the way we work and our day-to-day activities. That stress can also strip away the benefits of events that would normally be positive. 
						The stress that comes from debt can eliminate all happiness you get from spending money on yourself, family and other important things. 
						<br/>High debt levels have also significantly contributed to reduced marriage rates among young adults in the present day.
